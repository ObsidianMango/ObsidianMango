CryptoCritterz — Project Breakdown
1. High-Level Goal
CryptoCritterz is a web-based “virtual pet” app that blends gamified digital pets with crypto investing habits. The primary goal is to encourage healthier, more mindful crypto-checking behavior—rewarding self-control and lampooning obsessive price-watching—by evolving a digital critter that visually responds to the user’s checking frequency.

2. Core Concept
User “adopts” a virtual critter (or picks from several)

The critter’s appearance, mood, and evolution change based on how often the user checks the current Bitcoin (BTC) price

Frequent checking makes the critter stressed or anxious; infrequent/controlled checking makes it healthier, happier, and helps it evolve

The critter and a stylized TV displaying real-time Bitcoin data “live” in a cozy, animated, game-like digital room, with customizable wallpaper

3. Primary Features
A. Critter Status System
Six statuses:

Stressed (checked obsessively)

Anxious (checked frequently)

Balanced (moderate checking)

Zen (checked rarely)

Sleeping (barely checked)

Gone (abandoned for long period)

Status automatically updates based on check frequency over the past 24 hours and week.

B. Evolution Mechanic
Evolution:

Critter “evolves” only by maintaining Zen Master (minimal checking) status for 2 weeks

Each additional week at Zen evolves it further (new stages, new art)

C. Animated Critters
Each status and evolution stage has two animation frames (for blinking, breathing, etc.), giving the critter a lively, “pet-like” vibe.

D. Real BTC Data
TV in the room displays real-time Bitcoin price and a sparkline chart

Clicking the chart opens a modal with a longer time-frame chart (e.g., 1 week)

BTC price is fetched from a free public source (like blockchain.info, CoinPaprika, or a Google Finance widget)

E. Customizable Room
Room is stylized:

TV, critter, floor, wall, ceiling with some perspective

User can upload/choose their own seamless wallpaper PNG for the wall

Other decor possible as layers or overlays

F. Multiple Critters
User can swap/adopt between several different critter species, each with their own evolutions and art

4. User Experience Flow
User loads the app in browser/mobile (fully client-side, no sign-up needed)

Sees a stylized living room with animated critter and TV showing BTC price/chart

A “Check BTC” action (or just loading the app) counts as a check-in; check-ins are timestamped in local storage

The critter’s status and appearance update dynamically based on check history

If user maintains “Zen” for 2+ weeks, critter evolves; otherwise, status drops and evolution resets

Clicking the TV’s chart pops up a bigger chart with more timeframes

User can change critter or wallpaper from a settings menu (optional, not required at MVP)

5. Technical/Implementation Expectations
Art assets:

PNGs organized by critter species, status, evolution stage, and frame (naming: [status]_[evolution]_[frame].png)

State logic:

LocalStorage or IndexedDB for user check history, critter type, evolution stage, etc.

JS timers or date checks to compute current status, zen streaks, and evolve/reset as needed

BTC API:

Use public/free endpoints with minimal rate limiting

Chart rendering:

Lightweight chart rendering (QuickChart, sparkline PNGs, or similar)

Responsive UI:

Works on desktop and mobile; scalable layout

All-in-one HTML/JS/CSS (no server required for MVP)

No login/account needed (privacy friendly)

6. Thematic Tone/Style
Playful, tongue-in-cheek, a little sarcastic about crypto obsessions

Clean pixel/cartoon art, or any consistent stylized look

Room and interface should feel friendly, a “safe digital haven” (not sterile, not too noisy)

7. Stretch Features (Optional/Future)
Unlockable critters or evolutions for long Zen streaks

Fun critter “events”/random reactions based on major price swings

Critter mood messages (“Your Critter is nervous: you checked 8 times today!”)

Wallpaper store/gallery or drag-and-drop room items

TL;DR: One-Sentence Description
CryptoCritterz is a virtual pet web app where your digital critter evolves and reacts based on how often you check Bitcoin’s price—rewarding discipline with happy evolutions and playfully shaming obsessive behavior, all in a cozy, customizable digital living room.
