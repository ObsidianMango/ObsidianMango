<div id="onions" class="section">
    <h2>Onions</h2>
    <p>Onions are nutrient-dense and packed with vitamin B6, vitamin C, manganese, molybdenum (important for preserving tooth enamel), potassium, phosphorus, and copper. They are a rich source of quercetin, which works alongside vitamin C to eliminate bacteria, strengthen immunity, and provide anti-inflammatory benefits. Notably, the more pungent the onion, the greater its health properties.
</p><p>
For diabetics, onions are particularly beneficial due to their high chromium content, which helps cells respond to insulin. This is especially important for individuals who consume refined sugars, as these deplete the body’s chromium levels. Onions also help reduce blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and improve bone health. Their anti-inflammatory properties ease symptoms of asthma, arthritis, and respiratory congestion. Additionally, onions are effective in mitigating the adverse effects of colds and flus.</p>

<div id="peppers" class="section">
    <h2>Peppers (Capsicum)</h2>
    <p>Peppers, including bell and chili varieties, have long been celebrated in Native American medicine for their therapeutic properties. Capsaicin, a key nutrient found in peppers, acts as a natural pain reliever and neuro-inflammatory blocker, helping to alleviate joint and muscle aches. Native traditions often applied peppers topically to address pain.
</p><p>
Modern research has revealed additional benefits of capsaicin, including its potential role in managing type 1 diabetes, prostate cancer, and leukemia. Capsaicin is also linked to weight loss, stimulation of insulin-producing cells, and prevention of LDL cholesterol oxidation. Furthermore, it protects against stomach ulcers and promotes apoptosis (cancer cell death) in lung cancer.
</p><p>
Peppers are also rich in vitamins A, B1, B6, E, and K, along with potassium, magnesium, and iron. Yellow peppers, in particular, are high in lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that safeguard eye health and prevent blindness.</p>

<div id="tomatoes" class="section">
    <h2>Tomatoes</h2>
    <p>Tomatoes are a nutritional powerhouse and the richest source of lycopene, a carotenoid responsible for their vibrant red color. Lycopene is a potent antioxidant with well-documented benefits in preventing and treating cancers such as bladder, breast, cervical, lung, ovarian, prostate, and stomach cancer. Its anti-mutagenic properties also make it particularly beneficial for diabetics, who often have low blood lycopene levels.
</p><p>
Tomatoes support cardiovascular health by preventing cholesterol oxidation, reducing blood pressure, and lowering the risk of atherosclerosis. They also improve kidney function and possess antiviral and antibacterial properties, with lycopene specifically protecting against human papillomavirus (HPV), a cancer-linked pathogen.
</p><p>
In addition to lycopene, tomatoes are rich in B complex vitamins, potassium, manganese, chromium, folate, iron, and the amino acid tryptophan, which supports neurological health and promotes better sleep.
